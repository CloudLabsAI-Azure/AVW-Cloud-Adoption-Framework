# Exercise 1: Implement Azure landing zone accelerator
## Context

The Azure landing zone accelerator architecture is modular by design and allows organizations to start with foundational landing zones that support their application portfolios, regardless of whether the applications are being migrated or are newly developed and deployed to Azure. The architecture enables organizations to start as small as needed and scale alongside their business requirements regardless of scale point.
The AdventureWorks company wants to start with Landing Zones for their workload in Azure, where hybrid connectivity to their on-premise data center is not required from the start. 

### Reference Architecture

The Azure landing zone accelerator architecture is modular by design and allow organizations to start with foundational landing zones that support their application portfolios and add hybrid connectivity with ExpressRoute or VPN when required. Alternatively, organizations can start with an Azure landing zone accelerator architecture based on the traditional hub and spoke network topology if customers require hybrid connectivity to on-premises locations from the beginning.

A hub and spoke network topology allows you to create a central Hub VNet that contains shared networking components (such as Azure Firewall, ExpressRoute and VPN Gateways) that can then be used by spoke VNets, connected to the Hub VNet via VNET Peering, to centralize connectivity in your environment. Gateway transit in VNet peering allows spokes to have connectivity to/from on-premises via ExpressRoute or VPN, and also, [transitive connectivity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/create-a-transit-vnet-using-vnet-peering/) across spokes can be implemented by deploying User Defined Routes (UDR) on the spokes and using Azure Firewall or an NVA in the hub as the transit resource. Hub and spoke network design considerations & recommendations can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/traditional-azure-networking-topology).

## Customer Profile

This reference implementation is ideal for customers that have started their Azure landing zone accelerator journey with an Azure landing zone accelerator foundation implementation and then there is a need to add connectivity on-premises datacenters and branch offices by using a traditional hub and spoke network architecture. This reference implementation is also well suited for customers who want to start with Landing Zones for their net new
deployment/development in Azure by implementing a network architecture based on the traditional hub and spoke network topology.

- [Post deployment activities](#post-deployment-activities)

## Task 1: Explore the Azure Landing Zone environment.

### Overview

In this task, you will be reviewing the pre-deployed resources in the Azure Landing Zone accelerator. Here you will be using 4 dedicated subscriptions while deploying the Azure Landing Zone accelerator. All the resources are deployed in the Central US region, since the region will primarily be used to place the deployment resources in an Azure region but also used as the initial region for some of the resources that are deployed, such as Azure Log Analytics and Azure automation.

Find the detailed information about the resources which reside in respective subscriptions below:

**Management Subscription**: Under this subscription, the resources like Log Analytics Workspace and Monitoring solutions like Agent Health solution, Change Tracking solution, Update Management solution, Activity Log solution, VM Insights solution, Service Map solution, SQL Assessment solution, SQL Vulnerability Assessment solution, SQL Advanced Threat Protection solution are deployed. Also, the Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables security monitoring for your platform and resources and Microsoft Sentinel to deliver the intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise is also deployed in this subscription.

**Connectivity Subscription** : Under this subscription, the core networking platform resources, such as hub virtual network, gateways (VPN and/or ExpressRoute), Azure Firewall, DDoS Protection Standard, and Azure Private DNS Zones for Azure PaaS services are deployed and configured.

**Identity Subscription** : Under this Subscription, Azure Policy will be assigned at the scope to govern your identity resources. Below are the few policies that are assigned to your identity management group.

  - Prevent inbound RDP from the internet
  - Ensure subnets are associated with NSG
  - Prevent usage of public IP
  - Ensure Azure VMs (Windows & Linux) are enabled for Azure Backup

**Landing Zones Subscription** : You will use this Subscription for Virtual Network Address space. Provided subscription will be bootstrapped as landing zones and governed by Azure Policy. This subscription will be bootstrapped as landing zones with a virtual network deployed and connected to the hub virtual network for corp connectivity. Virtual networks on these subscriptions will be connected to the hub virtual network using VNet peering, and if you deployed and enabled Azure Firewall as a DNS proxy, DNS settings on these VNets will be configured with the Azure Firewall private IP address.

1. In the virtual machine, double click on the **Azure portal** shortcut on the desktop. If the credentials window pops up then enter the Azure credentials provided below.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
