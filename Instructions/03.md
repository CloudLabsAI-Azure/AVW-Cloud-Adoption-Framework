# Exercise 3: Enterprise Scale

## Context

The Enterprise-Scale architecture is modular by design and allows organizations to start with foundational landing zones that support their application portfolios, regardless of whether the applications are being migrated or are newly developed and deployed to Azure. The architecture enables organizations to start as small as needed and scale alongside their business requirements regardless of scale point.
The Wing Tip company wants to start with Landing Zones for their workload in Azure, where hybrid connectivity to their on-premise data center is not required from the start. 

### Reference architecture

This reference implementation is ideal for customers who want to start with Landing Zones for their workload in Azure, where hybrid connectivity to their on-premise data center is not required from the start. You can build a flexible structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management. The following diagram shows an example of creating a hierarchy for governance using management groups.

![](images/Refarch-MG.png) 

If your organization has many subscriptions, you may need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called **management groups** and apply your governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Azure Active Directory tenant.

In this exercise, you will learn about Management groups and how to manage the organization with policies.

>You will see **DeploymentID** value on the Environment details tab, please use it wherever you see DeploymentID in lab steps. This is a unique number associated with each lab deployment.

>**Note:** You will use the subscriptions L3 - ES Landing Zone Sub -Suffix and L3- ES Management Sub - Suffix for this exercise.

#### Task 1: Deploy the Management Group structure using ARM template and Policy Set definitions

In this task, you are deploying the foundational Management Group structure as well as the policy and PolicySet definitions. To deploy this we will use the Contoso reference implementation ARM template.

1. Copy the below url and paste it in the new tab in edge browser inside your labvm where you have already logged in to Azure portal, if credentails window popup again then enter your lab's Azure credentials.
   ```
   https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2FeslzArm%2FeslzArm.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2FeslzArm%2Feslz-portal.json
   ```

2. On the **Custom deployment** blade, in the Basics section, choose the **Region** as `CentralUS` and click on **Next: Azure core setup.**

3. On the **Enterprise-Scale Company Prefix** section, provide a company prefix (for this lab, we will use **ES** as the prefix). Please click **Next: Platform management, security, and governance** to move to the next section.
   - Management Group prefix: `ES`
   - Select dedicated subscriptions or single subscription for platformresources: `Dedicated`

   ![](images/cafud2.png) 
   
4. On the **Platform management, security, and governance** section, select the management subscription **L3- ES Management Sub - Suffix** and select **No** option for **Deploy Azure Security Center and enable security monitoring for your platform and resources**.


   Leave the other options set to default and Click on **Next:Platform DevOps and Automation** to move to the next section.

5. In the **Platform DevOps and Automation** section, select **No** option for Deploy integrated CICD pipeline? and click on **Next: Network Topology and connectivity** to move to the next section.

   - Deploy integrated CICD pipeline?: `No`

   ![](images/cafud3.png) 
   
6. In **Network Topology and connectivity** Select **No** and click on **Next: Identity**.

   - Deploy networking topology: `No`

   ![](images/cafud5.png) 

7. Under **Identity** select **No** for **Assign recommended policies to govern identity and domain controllers** and click on **Next: Landing zone configuration**.

   - Assign recommended policies to govern identity and domain controllers: `No`

   ![](images/cafud6.png) 

8. In landing zone configuration page leave everything as default and click on **Review + Create**.

   ![](images/cafud7.png) 
   
9. After the template has passed the validation, click **Create**. This will deploy the initial Management Group structure together with the required Policy/PolicySet definitions. It will also move the subscription under the right Management Group and will also deploy a Log Analytics Workspace and enable platform monitoring. This process will take around **10 minutes** to complete.

   ![](images/cafud8.png) 
   
10. To check the deployment status click on the **Notification** icon and click on **Deployment in progress**.

   ![](images/ex3-deploymentstatus.png)

11. Once the deployment is completed successfully, in the Azure Portal, type **Management Groups** into the search box and select the **Management Groups** under services. 

   ![](images/ex3-searchmanagementgrp.png)
 
12. Click on the **ES** Management Group. 
   
    ![](images/Ex3-dep-10p.png) 

13. You should see the following Management Groups in your environment:
    
    - ES-sandboxes
    - ES-platform
    - ES-landing zones
    - ES-decommissioned
    
    ![](images/Ex3-dep-11p.png) 

14. Next, in the **ES** Management Group blade, click on **Policy** under Governance section.

    ![](images/Ex3-dep-12p.png) 

15. In the **Policy | Definitions** blade, select the scope **ES** and under **Type** select **Custom**, you will see a list of Initiative and policy definitions as shown below which are assigned at the management group level.
   
    ![](images/Ex3-dep-13p.png) 

16. In the upper left corner of the portal window, to open the Resource Groups menu, click the toggle menu icon and then click on **Resource groups**.
    
    ![](images/ex1-resourcegroups.png)
    
    This blade displays all of the resource groups that you have access to the Azure subscriptions.
    
17. On the **Resource Groups** blade, Select the subscription **L3- ES Management Sub - Suffix** and select the resource group **ES-mgmt**.
     
    ![](images/Ex3-dep-15p.png)

18. On the **ES-mgmt** page, review the resources deployed by the ARM template
    
    ![](images/Ex3-dep-16p.png)

#### Task 2: Deploy Resources into an Enterprise scale landing zone (ESLZ).

#### Create a Key Vault and review Diagnostic settings

After deploying the ESLZ reference implementation (Wingtip), and bringing in a subscription for the platform management, policies are already assigned to ensure resources will have diagnostics/monitoring enabled.
    
1. In the Azure portal, type **key vault** at the search bar and select **Keyvaults** under services.
   
   ![](images/ex3-keyvaultsearch.png)
   
2. On the **Key vaults** page click on **+Create**. Please note you can also see ****+New** or **+Add** button in place of **+Create**.
     
   ![](images/ex3-keyvaultcreate.png)

3. **Create a key vault** by providing the following details:
   - Select the subscription **L3- ES Management Sub-Suffix** 
   - Under the Resource group Click on **Create New** and provide the name as **kvmgmt** and click on ok.
   - Provide the keyvault name : <inject key="Management KeyVault Name" style="color:IndianRed"/>
   - Region: `CentralUS`
   - Leave the default options for other details
   
    Click on **Review+Create**. After the template has passed the validation click **create** to create the key vault.
   
    ![](images/ex3t2-02.png)

4. Once the deployment is completed, navigate to **kvmgmt** resource group and select **Activity log** from the left hand menu, you should see that **deployIfNotExists** policy is enforced under the operation **Create Deployment** and it is the beginning of policy assignment. **Refresh** the activity log page until you see the **deployIfNotExists** policy(This may take upto 2 minutes to reflect in the activity log)
 
   ![](images/ex3-deployifnotexists.png)
   
   > Note: **deployIfNotExists** policy effect evaluates to determine if the Log analytics workspace is enabled for the key vault. If not, then a deployment to enable is executed by enforcing the policy.
 
5. Post a successful deployment of the Key vault, you should start to see (approximately 6-10 minutes) another deployment of the resource appearing in the resource group **kvmgmt** under **Deployments** section.
   
   ![](images/ex3t2-4.png)
   
 > Note: **deployIfNotExists** policy effect takes place and enables the Log analytics workspace for the key vault.
  
6. Navigate to the key vault you just created and review the **Diagnostics settings**, verify if it is connected to your **Log Analytics workspace**.

   ![](images/ex3t2-diagnosticsettings.png)
   
7. Now, on the key vault page, click on **Insights** under **Monitoring** and explore the Azure Monitor Insights view

   ![](images/ex3t2-insights.png)
  
8. Navigate to Azure **Policy**, select **Compliance** from the left hand menu and change the **scope** to **ES-management**. Review the compliance state of the assigned policies.

   ![](images/Ex3-tas2-8p.png) 
   
9. Next, you will check the policies that are **non-compliant** in your environment, and why.

10. Click on the first policy definition that is non-compliant.

    ![](images/ex3-task2-10.png)
    
11. Then click on the policy that is non-compliant from the **Policies** tab
    
    ![](images/ex3-task2-11.png) 
     
12. Next, under the **Resource compliance** tab, right click and select **Compliance reason** to know why the policy is non-compliant
     
    ![](images/ex3-task2-12.png) 
   
#### Task 3: Review Policy to your Landing Zone

As you saw in the previous task, policies ensure that security and compliance are being met regardless of how resources are being created. In this task, you will assign a new policy to ensure Key Vaults in the landing zones will always have soft-deletion enabled.

1. Type **Policy** at the search bar and select **Policy** under services.

   ![](images/ex2-policysearch.png)
      
2. Under **Policy** blade, select **Definitions** under the Authoring section and select the **ES-online** management group as scope.
    
    - Search for the policy **KeyVault SoftDelete should be enabled** and select it.
    
   ![](images/Ex3-tas3-2p.png)
   
   >Note: When a Key Vault is created without soft delete enabled then this policy Append-KV-SoftDelete is enforced and will enable the soft deletion. 
   
3. Review the policy definition **KeyVault SoftDelete should be enabled** and check what the policy will do on Key vault resources. Once reviewed, click on **Assign** to assign the policy to a particular scope.
   
   ![](images/ex3t2-8-v1.png)
   
4. **Assign** the policy at the **ES-online** management group scope, and provide the assignment a description as **This policy will ensure all key vaults are being created with soft deletion enabled**.

  - Leave the other options default and click on **Review + Create** for the assignment to be successfully applied.
   
    ![](images/Ex3-tas3-4p.png)
   
   >Assign the policy to enable soft deletion on key vault.

5. Click **Create** for the policy to be assigned.
   
   In this exercise, you deployed the Management Group structure using ARM template and Policy Set definitions and learned about the Enterprise scale landing zone

   Click on **Next** to proceed with the next exercise.

   Good to have suggestion to cover on the steps to configure some common scenarios users may face after setting up ESLZ :
igure
   1) Steps to add an empty subscription to management groups via ARM templates.
   2) Steps to move any subscription from one management group to another via ARM templates.
   3) Steps to clone a landing zone under a management group via ARM. For example, if  we want to have HR management group similar to corp governed with same set of policies and then add subsriptions under it.
