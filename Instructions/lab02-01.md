# Lab 02: AzGovViz- Azure Governance Visualizer

Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown and JSON?
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your HierarchyMap, creates a TenantSummary, creates DefinitionInsights and builds granular ScopeInsights on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group.

   > **Note:** The following lab is dependent on Lab 1, Exercise 1.

## Exercise 1: AzGovViz from Console

### Task 1: Execute as Service Principal

A Service Principal by default has no read permissions on Users, Groups and Service Principals, therefore we need to grant additional permissions in AAD

1. We need to Grant API permissions for the Service Principal´s Application, in Azure portal search for Active Directory *(1)* and click on **Azure Active Directory** from the search results *(2)*.
